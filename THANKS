My thanks to the following, who assisted with the development and testing
of minimodem.

  - Kamal Mostafa <kamal@whence.com>


Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com> was one of the first users of
minimodem and was instrumental in the testing of the initial versions.
He has used minimodem to debug suspend/resume issues, representing its
first practical application:

Thanks Colin!


Elektra <onelektra@gmx.net> provided encouragement and extensive help with
making minimodem work on an OpenWRT router, including testing the ALSA
back-end and runtime performance improvements for non-FPU systems.  Elektra
demonstrates and discusses minimodem on the German Freifunk radio show:

Thanks Elektra!


My employer Canonical, Ltd. for encouraging me to spend time developing
and maintaining this and other open-source projects.  Thanks, Canonical!
